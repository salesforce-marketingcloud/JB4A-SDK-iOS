MobilePush allows you to create and send targeted push messages based on cross-channel consumer data to encourage app usage and deliver increased ROI. With MobilePush, you view how users navigate through your app. From the products they view to the amount of time spent on each page, you gain a window into how users interact with your app across their smartphones and tablets. Because MobilePush is built on the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, you can easily integrate push message campaigns with any email, SMS, or social campaigns. The message wizard and preview features make it simple to create, deliver, and track push notifications to smartphones and tablets on iOS and Android operating systems, including Amazon devices.

MobilePush allows you to:

* Drive engagement and mCommerce
* Gain valuable user insight
* Easily build cross-channel campaigns
* Segment and schedule messages
