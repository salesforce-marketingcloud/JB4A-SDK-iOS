The Journey Builder for Apps SDK uses location capabilities to store end user location data in the ExactTarget database. You can use this information to target messages to a segmented group of contacts. The app pre-downloads geofence messages and triggers those messages when a mobile device crosses a geofence boundary. You must receive user permission to implement location services.

Note that the account using this functionality must have access to both MobilePush and Location Services in order to successfully receive location alerts.
